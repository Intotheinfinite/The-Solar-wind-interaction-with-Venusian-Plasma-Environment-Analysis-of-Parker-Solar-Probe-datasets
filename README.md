PSP spacecraft datasets observations and calculations were established to understand the magnetic fields around venus bow shock.
Transformed raw PSP spacecraft data using python library cdflib
Data was visualised with the aid of Python, Tableau, and Amda.cddp.edu, and estimates of the magnetic field Venusian Bow shock yielded reliable results.
New discoveries of magnectic field were generated via measurements, and the results were compatible with earlier findings.
